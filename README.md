## About this repo

This repo is a Django crud example. it consists of 3 small applications:

git clone git@github.com:tidbcloud/branching-django-example.git
cd apps
```

2. active virtual environment (Mac)

```

DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=
SSL_CA=
```

5. Migrate the schema

> make sure you have already created the database in TiDB Serverless before running the migrate command.

```
./manage.py migrate
```

6. Run the server

```
./manage.py runserver
```

## Use branching GitHub integration

Assume that you have run the Django project on a TiDB Serverless. Next, you can use the [Branching GitHub integration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/branch-github-integration) to connect the TiDB Serverless to this repo. Then a database branch will be created for every pull request to test the changes before merging the code to the master branch.

This repo has already connected to a TiDB Serverless. Check this [pull request](https://github.com/tidbcloud/branching-django-example/pull/2) to see how we check the migration changes!
